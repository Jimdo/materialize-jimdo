# Jimdo UI Library

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Jimdo/jimdo-ui-lib.svg?token=QVKuqZGwRrn1qkuX6PH1&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Jimdo/jimdo-ui-lib)

The Jimdo UI library is supposed to be an entry point for all UI development and should contain the following parts:

- UI code (eg Sass Library, JS/jQuery plugins, icons, UI components)
- UI/UX documentation (general patterns, technical setup and usage, UI design, usage of UI components, etc...)

Documentation should be generated as much as possible and use as much production code as possible.
